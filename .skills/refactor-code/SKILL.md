# Refactor Code Skill

Automates code refactoring to improve maintainability, readability, and performance.

## Quick Start

Use the `read` tool to view code, then use `edit` or `write` tools to make improvements.

## Capabilities

- Extract functions/methods
- Rename variables for clarity
- Simplify conditional logic
- Remove duplicate code
- Apply DRY principles

## Safety Guidelines

- Always use `--dry-run` first to preview changes
- Keep refactoring atomic and incremental
- Preserve behavior while improving structure

## Remember

- Refactor with purpose, not just for style
- Test after each significant change
- Commit frequently during refactoring
